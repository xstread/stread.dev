# About Me

Hello! I'm Stread, the person behind this website.

## What I Do

I'm passionate about clean, minimal, and elegant design - both in code and in life. This website is a reflection of those values. 

## My Interests

I'm interested in low-level systems and operating system concepts. Philosophically, I believe software and knowledge should be accessible to anyone who needs them.

## Contact

## About This Site

This website is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using the [Bear Cub theme](https://github.com/clente/hugo-bearcub). It aims to be:

- Minimal and fast
- Easy to read and navigate
- Free from unnecessary JavaScript and tracking
- Environmentally friendly (low bandwidth)
