# Welcome to My Blog! 

This is a clean, minimal, and suckless website built with Hugo and the Bear Cub theme. My goal is to serve original content with nothing else. No eyecandy, no bloat, no ads, no nonsense!

## About Me

I'm Stread, and this is my personal corner of the internet. Here, I share thoughts, projects, and anything else I find interesting.

## Join me!

For creating good content on the internet, last thing you need is fancy themes with bloated blog applications! You can even create a basic blog website with bash scripts!
