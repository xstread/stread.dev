This is my first post on my new Hugo-powered blog. I'm excited to start sharing my thoughts here.

## Why I chose a Minimal Website?

In today's web landscape filled with bloated websites, I've chosen to go with a minimalist approach:

1. **Faster loading times** - No unnecessary JavaScript or CSS
2. **Better user experience** - Clean and distraction-free reading
3. **Lower environmental impact** - Less data transfer means less energy consumption

This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and uses the excellent [Bear Cub theme](https://github.com/clente/hugo-bearcub).

Stay tuned for more content coming soon!
