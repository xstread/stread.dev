ccowsay is a rewritten version of the traditional cowsay app in C. When I first saw cowsay, I realized it was a good chance to improve my C skills. This code may have bad coding practices. It is not a complete equivalent of cowsay, but it has the key features. 

When I first thought about this project, my C knowledge was in the first steps of its evolution. It hasn't evolved quite a lot yet, but I'm working on it. ccowsay is unmaintained and not updated for some time now. I will start working on it again soon.

You can find the project on GitHub: [github.com/xstread/ccowsay](https://github.com/xstread/ccowsay)
